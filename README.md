A few extensions mentioned in the training are open source. Here are the vulnerable versions to follow along with the training:

Revoke.cash - https://github.com/RevokeCash/browser-extension/archive/refs/tags/v0.5.12.zip
MetaMask (for Blockaid bypasses) - https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/releases/tag/v11.10.0
Wallet Guard - https://github.com/wallet-guard/wallet-guard-extension/archive/refs/tags/v1.3.3.zip

Instructions for installing - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oswjtLwCUqg

If you get a manifest file error it's likely due to you not selecting the proper root directory - open from the directory with the version number.

For the remaining extensions that are not open source you can download them here from my repo.
